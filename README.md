# Propello Aero Challenge

## Installation
Install browser-sync globally
`npm install -g browser-sync`

Install Gulp-cli globally
`npm install -g gulp-cli`

Install All packages for this repository
`npm install`

## Start the program
Open your terminal and type (It will start the build and a localserver)

## Notes
For this challenge I decided to use [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com)
Didn't want to use any frameworks such as Vue.js, Angular or React as I wanted to keep it as simple as possible.

If I had more time (more than 2-3 hours) I would implement some tests.
